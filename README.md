# DOCUMENTATION-OF-HACKATHON-3

Day1_Laying_the_Foundation_for_Your_Marketplace TASK IS

Find out your marketplace  make your business goals and make a data schema of it .

we  have 3 Options:
o General E-Commerce
o Q-Commerce
o Rental E-Commerce 

after that create a data schema of it by describing the main componenets init 
 example 
 products ,orders shippement and payment.
 Focus on Key Fields for Each Entity: like.

 o Products: ID, Name, Price, Stock, Category, (e.g., Electronics, Clothing), Tags, (e.g., "New Arrival"). 
 o Orders: Order ID,  Customer Info, Product Details,  List of products,  Status, Timestamp.
 o Customers: Customer ID, Name, Contac,t Info Address,  Order History
o Shipment: Shipment ID,Order ID, Status, Delivery Date.

keep it simple and e schema is flexible enough to accommodate future growth or
changes.  
SUBMIT IT 


Day2_Planning_the_Technical_Foundation

 Technical Requirements
  Frontend Requirements:
  Sanity CMS as Backend:
  Third-Party APIs:

 Design System Architecture  or Blueprint.
 e.g 
 [Frontend (Next.js)]
 |
[Sanity CMS] ---------> [Product Data API]
 |
[Third-Party API] -----> [Shipment Tracking API]
 |
[Payment Gateway]


Example System Architecture:
[Frontend (Next.js)]
 | | |
[Sanity CMS] [3rd Party APIs] 

include Key Workflows in it .
1. User Registration:
2. Product Browsing:
3. Order Placement:
4. Shipment Tracking:

. Plan API Requirements
General eCommerce Example:
o Endpoint Name: /products
o Method: GET
o Description: Fetch all product details.
o Response Example: { "id": 1, "name": "Product A", "price": 100 }
Ensure API documentation aligns with marketplace-specific workflows to provide clarity
for implementation.
Based on your data schema, define the API endpoints needed. Include

 Endpoint Name: /products
o Method: GET
o Description: Fetch all available products from Sanity.
o Response: Product details (ID, name, price, stock, image). 

 Endpoint Name: /orders
o Method: POST
o Description: Create a new order in Sanity.
o Payload: Customer info, product details, payment status.

 Endpoint Name: /shipment
o Method: GET
o Description: Track order status via third-party API.
o Response: Shipment ID, order ID, status, expected delivery date

Key Workflows: System Architecture Visualized:Detailed API Requirements Documented: explain in the day 2 task.



DAY 3 - API INTEGRATION AND DATA MIGRATION  [E- COMMERCE]

 Understand the API
Action: The first step in API integration is to thoroughly review the API documentation
provided by the service. This documentation contains critical information on
available endpoints, data formats, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and
authentication methods.


> Set Up Authentication:-
> Obtain API Keys:
> Set Up Authentication
> Make API Requests to External Service
> Send Data to Sanity CMS.
> Process the Data

✓ Adjustment Made to Schemas:

   * Step 1: Add New Fields for API Data
   * Step 2: Adjust Data Types
   * Step 3: Create Relationships Between Tables
   * Step 4: Normalize Data
   * Step 5: Versioning and Data Validation



✓ Migration steps and tools used
   *  Assess Current Schema
   *  Prepare Data Mapping Plan
   *  Select Migration Tools
   *  Cleanse and Transform Data
   *   Migrate Data
   *   Verify Migration Success
   *   Post-Migration Adjustments
   *   Test and Optimize

   Submit the day 3 task.



   DAY 4 - BUILDING DYNAMIC FRONTEND COMPONENTS FOR YOUR MARKETPLACE 

   Steps for Implementation: 
1. Setup:

o React Testing Library: For component behavior testing. 
o Cypress: For end-to-end testing. 

3. How to Perform Functional Testing: 
o Write test cases for each feature. 
o Simulate user actions like clicking, form submissions, and navigation. 
o Validate the output against expected results. 

Step 2: Error Handling  use error message oby the use of try catch ,add fallback UI, Test Load Times

Step 4: Cross-Browser and Device Testing in which test on browsing device testing

Step 5: Security Testing   add input validation , secure API COMMUNICATION, TESTING TOOLS 
o OWASP ZAP: For automated vulnerability scanning. 
o Burp Suite: For advanced penetration testing. 

Step 7: Documentation Updates 

1. Include Testing Results: 
2. Submission Format: 
   o Submit documentation in PDF or Markdown format. 
   o Include test case details, testing tools used, and optimization steps. 

 Repository Submission: 
 > Upload all updated files, including the testing report, to your designated GitHub 
repository. 
> Ensure a clear folder hierarchy and include a README file summarizing updates 
and instructions for testing. 


Day_6_Deployment_Preparation_and_Staging_Environment:-

To deploy a project from a GitHub repository to Vercel, follow these structured instructions: 
Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository 
1. Create a GitHub Repository (if you don’t have one already): 
2. Go to GitHub. 
3. Create a new repository or use an existing one. 
4. Push your project’s code to the repository if it’s not already there. 
2. Check for Required Files: Ensure that your repository contains the necessary files for your 
project. Common files might include: 
1. package.json for Node.js projects. 
2. next.config.js for Next.js projects. 
3. vercel.json (optional) for custom configuration. 
Step 2: Create a Vercel Account 
1. Sign up or Log in to Vercel: 
2. Visit Vercel. 
3. Sign up with GitHub (or another supported provider). 
4. Connect Your GitHub Account to Vercel: 
5. After logging in, go to the Dashboard. 
6. Click on New Project. 
7. Vercel will ask you to connect your GitHub account (if not already done). Allow Vercel to 
access your repositories. 
Step 3: Deploy from GitHub to Vercel 
1. Import Your GitHub Repository: 
2. After linking your GitHub account, Vercel will show your repositories. 
3. Select the repository you want to deploy. 
4. Configure Build Settings: 
5. Vercel will auto-detect the framework and settings (for example, Next.js, React, etc.). 
2. If Vercel does not detect the correct settings, you can manually specify the build command, 
output directory, etc. 
Common configurations
 1. Build Command: e.g., npm run build or next build 
2. Output Directory: e.g.,./out or .next 
3. Set Environment Variables (if needed): 
4. If your project uses environment variables, you can set them during the setup process. 
5. Deploy: 
6. After configuring, click Deploy. 
7. Vercel will start the deployment process. 
8. Once completed, you’ll get a live URL where your project is deployed. 
Step 4: Post-Deployment Steps 
1. Access the Live Application: 
2. Vercel will provide a live URL to your deployed project, typically in the format your
project-name.vercel.app. 
3. Automatic Deployments on Push: 
4. After the initial deployment, Vercel will automatically redeploy the project on any changes 
you push to the connected GitHub repository. 
5. Check Build Logs: 
6. If there are any issues with the deployment, you can check the build logs in the Vercel 
dashboard to debug. 
Optional: Add Custom Domain 
1. Set Up Custom Domain (if applicable): 
2. Go to the Settings of your deployed project in Vercel. 
3. Under the Domains section, you can add a custom domain. 
4. Follow the instructions for connecting your domain (DNS configuration). 
Optional: Configure vercel.json 
For custom configurations, you can create a vercel.json file in the root of your project. Example 
configurations: 
json 
Copy 
{ 
 "version": 2, 
 "builds": [ 
   { 
     "src": "index.js", 
     "use": "@vercel/node" 
   } 
 ], 
 "routes": [ 
   { 
     "src": "/api/(.*)", 
     "dest": "/api/$1.js" 
   } 
 ] 
} 
 
 Version: Specifies the version of Vercel's deployment platform. 
 Builds: Specifies how to build and deploy the project. 
 Routes: Configures URL rewrites or redirects. 
 
Conclusion 
Once you've followed these steps, your GitHub project will be deployed on Vercel with continuous 
deployment enabled. Every time you push changes to the GitHub repository, Vercel will 
automatically redeploy the project.
     

Performance testing results.
